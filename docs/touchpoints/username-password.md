# UsernamePasswordTouchpoint Component Documentation

The `UsernamePasswordTouchpoint` component is a custom Lit element designed to handle user authentication via username and password input. This component is part of a larger authentication flow, potentially including biometric sign-in options. It emphasizes user experience by providing clear feedback and alternative authentication methods.

## Properties

- `globalStyles`: An `Object` used to pass global style configurations to the component, affecting its visual presentation.
- `signInWithBiometricPrompt`: An `Object` containing configuration for biometric sign-in prompts, although its usage in this component is more related to the broader sign-in context.
- `passwordSignIn`: An `Object` containing specific configurations for password sign-in, including `headline`, `buttonText`, and `message`, along with visibility toggles for certain UI elements.
- `platformSpecificIcons`: An `Object` that may include icons or visuals specific to different platforms or authentication methods.
- `currentStep`: A `Function` callback to determine the current step of the authentication process, influencing the component's rendered state.
- `isError`: A `Function` callback to check for errors in authentication steps, providing appropriate feedback to the user.
- `started`: A `Boolean` indicating if the authentication process has been initiated, potentially altering the UI to reflect processing status.
- `login`: An `Object` containing login details, such as the user's identifier, to prepopulate fields or maintain state across steps.
- `performLogin`: A `Function` callback executed to perform the login action with provided credentials.
- `inputDisabled`: A `Boolean` flag that disables input fields when true, useful in controlling user interactions based on the process state.
- `signInAnotherWay`: A `Function` providing users with an alternative method for signing in, enhancing flexibility and accessibility.
- `startOver`: A `Function` to reset the authentication process, offering users a way to correct mistakes or change methods.

## Rendering Logic

The component dynamically renders different UI elements based on the current step in the authentication process:

- **Username Input**: Displayed if the current step involves providing a username, leveraging the `start-touchpoint` component for user input.
- **Password Input**: Revealed when the authentication process advances to password input, including error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
- **Alternative Sign-In**: Offers a button to switch to another sign-in method, catering to users who prefer or require different authentication options.

## Example Usage

    }}
    .login=${{
        userIdentifier: 'user@example.com'
    }}
    .performLogin=${(credentials) => console.log('Logging in with:', credentials)}
    .signInAnotherWay=${() => console.log('Switching to another sign-in method.')}
    .startOver=${() => console.log('Starting over.')}
></username-password-touchpoint>
